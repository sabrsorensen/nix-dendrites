 * over-popped whenever a page had been reached without a counted push, and
 * under-popped when several uncounted pushes had happened. Both go wrong in
 * the same visible way: B in the QAM closes it and reveals a stale Nexus
 * page instead of the game.
 *
 * Never negative: over-popping walks into Steam's own screens, which is
 * worse than leaving one of ours behind.
