// Full-screen Health Check: everything wrong with a setup that the game
// will not tell you about until it refuses to start.
//
// Michael asked for this months ago and was talked out of it. One day of
// testing Slay the Spire 2 settled the argument - two mods silently did not
// load for want of a library, a collection's stale pinned libraries broke
// four more, mods were switched off that had fixes published on their pages,
// and a collection listed mods Nexus no longer serves. Every one of those
// was knowable, and none of it appeared anywhere a player would look.
//
// It is a diagnostics screen, which is exactly why it needs to look good:
// somebody opens this when they are already frustrated, and a wall of red
// text is the last thing that helps. So the page leads with a verdict big
// enough to read from a sofa, and only then the detail.
